-- in a SQL server... you have many databases.
-- within each database, we have many "schemas"
-- a schema is a namespace/scope for database objects

-- in AdventureWorksLT database, we have schema SalesLT
-- inside schemas, we have many db objects, incl. tables

-- this WOULD switch databases (from master),
-- but Azure SQL DB doesn't support it yet.
USE AdventureWorks;
-- have to use dropdown instead.

-- whitespace doesn't matter

-- semicolons aren't necessary
-- SQL syntax is case-insensitive

-- SQL's string comparison by default is also case-insensitive
-- but really that depends on the "collation" i.e. the
-- settings for datetime format, number format

-- the SELECT statement ...
-- doesn't even need to access the DB
